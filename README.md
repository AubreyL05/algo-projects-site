## Projects

### Sorting Visualizer
A web-based sorting visualizer that demonstrates how different sorting algorithms work by animating the sorting process. Currently includes:
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- (Insertion Sort coming soon!)

Features:
- Adjustable array size and sorting speed
- Pause, resume, and restart controls
- Upload custom arrays via CSV (planned)
